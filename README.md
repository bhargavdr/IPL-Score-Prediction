# IPL-Score-Prediction
This project aims to predict the total score of a cricket team at the end of their innings during an IPL match. The model is built using historical data from IPL seasons 1 to 9 (2008-2016) and tested on data from season 10 (2017). The model uses various machine learning algorithms to predict the score.
